# FORECAST Gleason Analysis

This repository contains the code for the analysis of output of the Gleason segmentation pipeline as part of the whole slide analysis detailed in the paper *Tumor evolution metrics predict recurrence beyond 10 years in locally advanced prostate cancer* by Fernandez-Mateos, Cresswell, Trahearn, *et al*.

Included are scripts for both Gleason Grading and computation of the Gleason Morisita index.
